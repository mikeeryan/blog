How to choose the right one for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I would recommend examining their business model before digging into the course content. Check if they charge per course/certificate or a monthly subscription. Compare based by estimating your total long term costs. Also consider how the content is made available to you. Will you have to keep up with the classes on tight schedules or are the schedules more flexible? Think what would work the best for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, after reviewing several schools, I settled on Udacity and been with them for the past three years. What attracted me was that their content was freely available. I could watch their videos for free at my own pace. I did not pay anything until I was ready to take the plunge and enroll in their nanodegree program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I enrolled in the &lt;a href=" https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002" target="_blank"&gt; Data Analyst Nanodegree&lt;/a&gt; they charged a monthly subscription fee. So, the final cost depended on how quickly I could submit the final projects for each module of the degree. I took advantage of this model and studied all the courses before enrolling. That way when I enrolled, I paid only for a few months during which I was mainly working on the projects and did not have to study a lot of new material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, a little bit later Udacity modified this model to generate more review. Today they charge a flat fee for each fixed length term of their nanodegrees. There are now recommended deadlines for the completion of each module but it's still pretty flexible because there are no live classes or weekly assignments. As long as you turn in the projects more or less on time and do not fall behind too much, you will graduate successfully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still study in advance of enrolling but you will not save any money by graduating early because you have to pay a flat fee. This is how my experience was for my second certificate - &lt;a href=" https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t" target="_blank"&gt;Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to review the content of the modules closely. Udacity has expanded their roster of nanodegrees quite a bit. Inevitably, they nerfed some of the programs and moved some of their content to other programs. Also, there is overlap between the programs, so choose wisely to save money and time (which is also money anyway). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, Udacity has almost 200 free courses for you to study at your own pace. I have completed 30+ of them so far, and I wish I had more time to complete many more. Definitely take advantage of this free content before you enroll in any Nanodegree program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck and Have Fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="schools"></category></entry><entry><title>Publishers and Books</title><link href="https://mikeeryan.github.io/blog%5Cfourth-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-03T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-02-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Michael Eryan</name></author><id>tag:mikeeryan.github.io,2019-02-03:/blog\fourth-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post I mention some of my favorite publishers and books in the Data Science field.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many great publishers and books on Data Science. I would like to mention the ones I have benefitted from the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href="https://www.manning.com" target="_blank"&gt;Manning Publishing.&lt;/a&gt; What I like about their books is how well the chapters are organized. At least the ones I have read, all had similar structures, good code listings with comments, tables and screenshots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a great introductory level book using Python - &lt;a href="https://www.manning.com/books/introducing-data-science" target="_blank"&gt;Introducing Data Science, 2016&lt;/a&gt; It covers the main concepts of data science, machine learning, distributed computing, NoSQL and Graph databases, text analytics, data visualization and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just read this preface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;It’s in all of us. Data science is what makes us humans what we are today. No, not the computer-driven data science this book will introduce you to, but the ability of our brains to see connections, draw conclusions from facts, and learn from our past experiences. More so than any other species on the planet, we depend on our brains for survival; we went all-in on these features to earn our place in nature. That strategy has worked out for us so far, and we’re unlikely to change it in the near future.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;But our brains can only take us so far when it comes to raw computing. Our biology can’t keep up with the amounts of data we can capture now and with the extent of our curiosity. So we turn to machines to do part of the work for us: to recognize patterns, create connections, and supply us with answers to our numerous questions. The quest for knowledge is in our genes. Relying on computers to do part of the job for us is not—but &lt;strong&gt;it is our destiny&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn't it sound like Dataism manifesto?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The other publisher I like is &lt;a href="https://www.packtpub.com" target="_blank"&gt;Packt.&lt;/a&gt; They have a great variety content and their books do not all look alike. They have great deal on eBooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick just one book to explain Machine Learning, I would undoubtedly pick &lt;a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition" target="_blank"&gt;Python Machine Learning, 2017&lt;/a&gt;  by the great Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili. After getting through a whopping 500+ pages I had only one complaint - I wish it were longer! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great content covering from the simplest algorithms to complex neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning. Explains well what embeddings are and how back propagation works - hint: there is no sorcery involved. Uses scikit-learn and Tensorflow, and even walks you through how to create a simple predictive web app using Flask. I wish they follow up with a similarly great book on Reinforcement Learning. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="books"></category><category term="publishers"></category></entry></feed>
