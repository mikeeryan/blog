Title: About

I created this blog to share the cream of all the knowledge I have been gathering in the field of data science, machine learning and Python programming.

My background is economics, statistics and, more recently, machine learning.
Since graduating with my masters degree programming SAS has been my bread and butter. Also acquired extensive experience in SQL and relational databases. 

I am openly pro-Python and anti-R biased.

When I am not learning Python and data science I like to play PC games, play with my cat and meditate.
