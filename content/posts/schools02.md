Summary: In this post I talk about my experience with a premier technology learning platform. 

<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank"> Pluralsight </a> is a popular learning platform among technology departments of large companies. It is a subscription-based online school so make sure you check if your company already has a partnership with them before buying a personal subscription. 

So far I have taken two "paths" on Pluralsight: <a href=" https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/python" target="_blank"> "Python" </a> and <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/the-scrum-framework" target="_blank">"Using the Scrum Framework."</a>

The Python path is a collection of eleven courses split into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. Out of all the courses, I have to admit, that the best are the three courses by Robert Smallshire and Austin Bingham. These courses are "Python fundamentals," "Python beyond the basics," "Advanced Python" that follow their books "The Python Apprentice," "The Python Journeyman," and "The Python Master" available from this <a href=" https://leanpub.com/u/abingham" target="_blank"> publisher here. </a>

The three courses by Smallshire and Bingham are the best on Python that I have found. They describe their approach as a "spiral" with higher level courses going deeper into the previously discussed topics. I think it's a great approach that allows to acquire a deep fundamental understanding of this wonderful programming language. 

The other courses in the Python path range from very basic introductions to "type along without understanding" to testing and, at least to me, did not have that much value. 

Pluralsight also has "soft-skill" courses as well. I took the <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/the-scrum-framework" target="_blank">"Using the Scrum Framework"</a> path to quickly gain an understanding of Agile and Scrum. If you wish to learn that too, I do recommend you read the official guides to understand the basics first. Then you can take this course which will give you a thorough understanding and plant a vision in your head of a typical Scrum environment. The course author Jeremy Jarrell has done a great job of creating a realistic environment that will help you identify with the Scrum team members. This will help you to demystify Scrum and grant you confidence that you will succeed in such an environment in the future.
