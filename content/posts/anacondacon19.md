Summary: This is my summary of the AnacondaCon 2019 that I attended in Austin, TX.

This week I had the pleasure of attending <a href="https://anacondacon.io/" target="_blank"> AnacondaCon </a> in Austin, TX. Great party and great sessions. 
Some of my colleagues joined me as well. Here is a picture with my friend and colleague Ryan.

Best of all I got to meet and hang out with several Python celebrities. 

I saw Francois  Chollet present his vision on the design of APIs that he materialized into his very popular <a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank"> Keras </a> library. He is also the author of a great book on <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python" target="_blank"> Deep Learning </a> which would interesting to re-read now that I have met him in person.

At the afterparty I got to meet Travis Oliphant - the founder of Anaconda and the creator of the <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" target="_blank"> NumPy </a> and contributor to the <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank"> SciPy </a>  libraries on which many other libraries have been built.

Overall, had a great time and would definitely attend again.
